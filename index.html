The first time i saw you in that Yellow dress I couldn’t believe my eyes , I was completely mesmerised by your beautiful eyes. If this world was a fantasy world then You would have been a princess in a castle. 
<br>
I know this is a bit early and might be sudden that I am pouring out my heart to you today... but I cannot imagine us being so far away from each other. Every minute feels like a torture when I cannot talk to you. 
<br>
I know this might sound very mushy but I think you are the one i have been wanting for so long( is it too corny?? I don’t know)
<br>
You know what... I never believed in my dreams but the one dream I have with you in it.. I so wish that to come true... 
<br>
I wish I could be beside you watching you read this and adore your elusive smile. That is something I can’t get enough of. 
I cannot find enough words to explain how beautiful you are... 
your enchanting eyes... 
your kiddish smiles ... 
which brings joy to my heart... 
your voice which calms me down... 
your thoughts which overpower me throughout the day... 
<br>
you have no idea how many times I go through your profile to see those beautiful pictures but I always seem to run out of them and I get sad when I can’t scroll down more. 
<br>
I don’t know if it’s a good thing or a bad thing but with every notification on my phone I hope it’s you. I wanna tell you so much more and even after that it will be less but I can’t stop myself from falling in love with you. 
<br>
I know it’s a bit direct and too prompt but I want you to know that In these last few days I have never been so happy and all my sadness vanishes when you are deep in my conscious. 
<br>
I know you might have heard this before from others but I love you Payal, I have never understood the true meaning of these words before meeting you. And I hope I can do justice to these words and give you all the love in this world which you truly deserve.
<br>
I'm sorry but my hearts beat for you.
I feel I have found my match...❤️❤️❤️
<br>
I LOVE YOU more than yesterday but less than tomorrow...
Can you be a part of my Happiness and my Sorrow ?
<br>
I want us to Grow together , in the path of life.. Life is too short sweetheart.. Lets figure it out together ??? ❤️
<br>
Its a love story , baby just say yes ❤️

who can turn my gloomy day into mornings of beautiful sunshine,<br>
Wearing a million dollar smile , she can make my world to go from ok-ok to fine :)<br>
<br>
Her sweet voice can turn the chaos into charmness ,<br>
Not listening to her , i lose all my calmness,<br>
My heart longs to listen to her all day ,<br>
Is this the defination of love ? They say.<br><br>

What about the time when she is sad ?<br>
Trust me , it wrecks my heart.<br>
The sweet mornings turns into darkness,<br>
the night turns out to be endless.<br><br>

I wish I could turn her sadness into chunks of joyy,<br>
She is so cute , she looks like a sweet little toy,<br>
Not eating Louki makes her nauseous,<br>
Don't mess with her eating schedule I warn you , Oh Boy!<br><br>

Her friends are my friends and her enemies are mine!<br>
Anyone has to hurt her , has to go through the heart of mine! ❤️<br>
That one girl, I love her smile! <br>

            She was cute back then, living just by my side,<br>
            I wished I had talked to her and trust me I wanted to!<br>
            But this shy heart of mine , could not! which just knows how to hide!<br>
            <br><br>
            On a new year eve , she showed up being pretty again ! <br>
            Oh wait I have to smile! No I can't, it may seem creepy, Will I never talk to her ? Oh shut up my overthinking mind, she is just a normal girl, nothing to hype. <br>
            <br><br>
            My eyes hung up on her , sneaky enough , to not let her know!<br>
            She is not normal, she is something special ❤️ My heart some how started to flow!<br><br>
            <br><br>
            Was it an infatuation ? Was it something deep?<br>
            What there something more for us ? ❤️ <br>
            Or am i just an over thinking creep!<br>
            <br><br>
            I no longer used to live beside her,<br>
            She had such a face, I could never forget her,<br>
            I wish I knew her better, there has to be something more to her , I sighed, I wish I had talked to her , all I have is regret. <br>
            Little Heart of mine, could never forget.<br>
            <br><br>
            So this wasn't the end? ❤️<br>
            Thanks to Mark Zuckerberg , she became my friend! <br>
            Though virtually , I could connect! All I could say is "Remember me" ?<br>
            And she came up with this sweetest "Yes" of all time ! ❤️❤️❤️<br>
            I know this may not rhyme ! But she knew i existed and this filled my heart with joy! <br>
            <br><br>
            We became good friends eventually, yet i knew very little about her!<br>
            We decided to meet , but i feared falling for her!<br>
            She looked so pretty that I started talking my shit out,<br>
            After all that , all I could come up was a desperate proposal, but she backed out! 💔<br>
            <br><br>
            So was this an end ?<br>
            Time flew by, we were busy living our lives,<br>
            Well I always followed her and awed over her beauty ❤️<br>
            Secretly I always admired her , and why should i not ? she is such a cutie ❤️ I mean just look at her 😊<br>
            <br><br>
            All of a sudden destiny turned upon,<br>
            the best wheels of fortune was yet to come,<br>
            we began talking again ❤️<br>
            And this time it was all different!<br>
            It just felt , somehow we are more than friends!<br>
            <br>
            We began to talk day and night, <br>
            She keeps me busy with her cute talks and cutest smile!<br>
            Her lil joyous stories filled me with joy , i could listen to her speaking all day ❤️<br>
            The day she goes without talking go wasted,<br>
            Lifeless life of mine feels so unworthy untasted.<br>
            <br>
            Was she the missing link in the life?<br>
            Why do I feel so relived and joyous when she is there beside?<br>
            I feel so attached to her in a short span, the way i am feeling this time, feels like something good about to happen :)<br>
            
            <br>
            The way I started feeling for her is unmatched,<br>
            My heart beats for her ,<br>
            All I could think the whole day is about her,<br>
            I feel like talking to no one but her , <br>
            Even though we may not speak , the silence is better than most of the words that I ever utter! When i am with her , perfect is just a metaphor!
            <br><br>
            At times , I do feel hurt that she is not mine yet 💔<br>
            The person whom you adore the most in the world, <br>
            Is not there yet.<br>
            But those pains and sleepness nights where worth going for,<br>
            Is that even love , when you are not fighting it over ?<br>
            <br><br>
            Finally the most beautiful day of my life knocked!<br>
            We met and we made love!<br>
            I saw the love in her eye and I have never felt so special,<br>
            This was something different ❤️ this was not occasional!<br>
            <br>
            We kissed and we touched each other.<br>
            Lips to lips , hands to hand, feet to feet,<br>
            We were so into each other ❤️<br>
            She is certainly the most beautiful girl in the world . no one else could be more beautiful I can bet. She is next to perfect ❤️ All my pains and waits were over the moment i kissed her , I knew she is mine and mine, forver ❤️
